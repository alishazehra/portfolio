       Hi, I'm Syeda Alisha Zehra! I am a passionate tech enthusiast and educator with a strong foundation in web development. I have expertise in TypeScript, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, which I use to create engaging and interactive web applications. Currently, I am exploring Next.js and working on various projects.

I have completed my O levels and A levels, and I am currently enrolled in the Cloud Applied Generative AI course from Governor House. Alongside my technical pursuits, I aspire to teach coding to kids and inspire them to explore the world of technology.

In addition to my development skills, I am studying AS Sociology 9699, focusing on ethnic identities and concepts like the Hawthorne effect. I enjoy sharing my knowledge through my YouTube channel, "Shine Whispers," where I create videos to help others learn TypeScript.

I am actively seeking opportunities in the IT sector, particularly in roles that allow me to leverage my skills in React and web development. My goal is to create impactful applications and contribute to the tech community while fostering a love for coding in the next generation.

Thank you for visiting my page, and feel free to connect with me!
